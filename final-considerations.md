# ‚è≠Ô∏è Final Considerations

We are thrilled to have you join us for this inaugural edition of  **K8SUG CTL: Hands-On Workshop for LLM Deployment on K8S**. Your participation today is a significant step towards mastering the deployment and management of AI applications using Kubernetes.

As we wrap up, here are a few key takeaways and what you can look forward to in our future sessions:

* **Key Takeaways:**
  * You've gained practical experience in setting up a Kubernetes cluster on Azure.
  * You've learned how to deploy and manage applications using Helm.
  * You've tested and ensured the resilience of your application.
  * You've updated configurations and scaled deployments on demand.
  * You've performed a clean uninstallation process using Helm.

### **Looking Ahead:**

Next time, we will explore advanced tools and platforms that leverage Kubernetes to streamline the AI lifecycle even further. Stay tuned for our upcoming workshops, where we will showcase **Kubeflow**, **MLflow**, and **DoEKS**, platforms that integrate seamlessly with Kubernetes to enhance your AI development and deployment processes.

*   #### What is Kubeflow?

    The **Kubeflow** project is dedicated to making deployments of machine learning (ML) workflows on Kubernetes simple, portable, and scalable. Its goal is not to recreate other services, but to provide a straightforward way to deploy best-of-breed open-source systems for ML to diverse infrastructures. Anywhere you are running Kubernetes, you should be able to run Kubeflow.
* **What is MLflow?**\
  MLflow is a solution to many of these issues in this dynamic landscape, offering tools and simplifying processes to streamline the ML lifecycle and foster collaboration among ML practitioners.
* **What is DoEKS?**\
  **Data on Amazon EKS (DoEKS)** is a comprehensive toolset and framework designed to facilitate the building of scalable, efficient, and managed data platforms on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). It provides a robust infrastructure that integrates various open-source data tools and AWS managed services, enabling users to deploy and manage data solutions effectively.

#### Additional Note:

Today, we focused on the deployment of a model as backend/frontend to be used on Kubernetes. However, the AI/ML lifecycle in its entirety can also greatly benefit from using Kubernetes. Future workshops will delve into this broader scope, highlighting how Kubernetes can optimize each stage of the AI/ML lifecycle.

Thank you for being part of the K8SUG community. Your enthusiasm and commitment to learning are what drive the success of our events. Let's continue building the future of AI together! ü§ñü§ù
