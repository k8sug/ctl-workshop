# ‚è≠Ô∏è Final Considerations

We are thrilled to have you join us for this inaugural edition of the **Kubernetes & AI: Hands-On Workshop for LLM Deployment Mastery**. Your participation today is a significant step towards mastering the deployment and management of AI applications using Kubernetes.

As we wrap up, here are a few key takeaways and what you can look forward to in our future sessions:

* **Key Takeaways:**
  * You've gained practical experience in setting up a Kubernetes cluster on Azure.
  * You've learned how to deploy and manage applications using Helm.
  * You've tested and ensured the resilience of your application.
  * You've updated configurations and scaled deployments on demand.
  * You've performed a clean uninstallation process using Helm.
* **Looking Ahead:** Next time, we will explore advanced tools and platforms that leverage Kubernetes to streamline the AI lifecycle even further. Stay tuned for our upcoming workshop, where we will showcase **Kubeflow** and other platforms that integrate seamlessly with Kubernetes to enhance your AI development and deployment processes.
*   #### What is Kubeflow?

    The Kubeflow project is dedicated to making deployments of machine learning (ML) workflows on Kubernetes simple, portable and scalable. Our goal is not to recreate other services, but to provide a straightforward way to deploy best-of-breed open-source systems for ML to diverse infrastructures.\
    \
    Anywhere you are running Kubernetes, you should be able to run Kubeflow.

Thank you for being part of the K8SUG community. Your enthusiasm and commitment to learning are what drive the success of our events. Let's continue building the future of AI together! ü§ñü§ù
